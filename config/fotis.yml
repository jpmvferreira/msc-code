## fotis.yml
# smc-stan configuration file to test the model present in arXiv:2104.15123 using standard sirens


### Sampler configuration
# The names of the parameters
# Must match the names defined in the stan model file!
names: [h, Omega_m, Omega_r]

# The labels to show in the plots and tables, for each parameter.
# Defaults to the name of each parameter if not provided.
# Latex is supported (dollar sign not required).
labels: [h, \Omega_m, \Omega_r]

# Initial condition for each parameter, for each walker.
# The most relevant initial conditions available are:
# - gauss(mu, sigma)
# - uniform(a, b)
# - float(a)
initial:
  h: gauss(0.68, 0.15)
  Omega_m: gauss(0.353, 0.1)
  Omega_r: gauss(0.021, 0.005)

# Line markers to show rendered in the plots.
# These are optional and can be used to represent the true or expected values.
markers:
  h: 0.68
  Omega_m: 0.353
  Omega_r: 0.021

# Number of steps to sample the posterior distribution, after the warmup.
samples: 2500

# Number of steps to warmup each chain, which will be discarded.
warmup: 1000

# Number of chains to run.
# Defaults to all available hardware threads.
# Will run in parallel or sequentially based on the number of available threads.
# Keep in mind that each chain will do a total number of steps = warmup + samples.
chains: 4
