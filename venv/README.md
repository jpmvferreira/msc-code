This folder includes the information about the virtual environment used to develop the work in this repository, as well as its changes throughout time.

The `.yml` files are managed by micromamba, a conda compatible package manager, whereas the .txt files are packages managed by pip.

It should be noted that some packages (namely my packages) managed by pip might be installeed locally in edit mode and might throw an error on intalling specific versions. In that case install them manually for the corresponding repositories.
