  Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:

You should consider using a more robust model, this is because importance sampling is less likely to work well if the marginal posterior and LOO posterior are very different. This is more likely to happen with a non-robust model and highly influential observations.
