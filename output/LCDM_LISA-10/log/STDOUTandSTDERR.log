  1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 8.11 seconds.

  Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:

  If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
  but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

You should consider using a more robust model, this is because importance sampling is less likely to work well if the marginal posterior and LOO posterior are very different. This is more likely to happen with a non-robust model and highly influential observations.
