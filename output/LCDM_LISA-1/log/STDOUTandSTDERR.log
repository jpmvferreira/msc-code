Messages received during sampling:
  Gradient evaluation took 0.00142 seconds
  1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 14.2 seconds.

  Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:

  If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
  but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
